<th style="color:white">Hi! My name is Ennor Armah and I am currently a student at the University of Georgia. I am a Biology major. I am from Cumming, Georgia. I am a nice, cute guy. Did I mention that I am good with parents. I have a Mom and a Dad and little brother and little sister. I love my family a lot. I have a very close group of friends that I can talk to about anything. I have a German Shepard named Wolf and he is the best friend a man could have. This class has taught me so much. I've learned a lot this semester from my TA, Prannay.The Dawgs are going to the SEC Championship and I am so excited.

<th>This is Ennor aka the Kid. Ennor loves to watch and play football. 
<p></p>Ennor's favorite football team is the Atlanta Falcons. Ever since I moved to Atlanta in 2006, I instantly became a fan. I finally understood football, and Mike Vick was still playing at the time. He was one of the view African American quarterbacks that could take over the game and make you pay for not planning for him.
<p></p>His favorite Falcons player is Michael Vick! Michael Vick is one of the greatest players to ever play the game. He took the quarterback postion and changed it forever. Defenses had to game plan for Vick. It was almost impossible to stop him. Vick had arun in with the law, but I don't think you should put that against the man's legacy.
